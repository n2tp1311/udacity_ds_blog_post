## Churn Detection Model Based on Credit Information

### Overview

This notebook contains a machine learning model to detect incoming churn customers based on their credit information.
The goal is to identify customers who are likely to stop making payments and take appropriate actions to mitigate
financial risk.

### Contents

- **Data Loading & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis.
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** Visualizing distributions and correlations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- **Model Training:** Implementing machine learning models to predict churn.
- **Evaluation:** Measuring model performance using appropriate metrics.

### Dependencies

The notebook requires the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn`

Ensure you have these installed before running the notebook.

### Usage

1. Load the dataset into the notebook.
2. Run the preprocessing and EDA sections to understand the data.
3. Train the model and evaluate its performance.
4. Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

### Notes

- The model assumes clean and structured credit data.
- Further hyperparameter tuning may be required for optimal performance.
- Interpretability techniques such as SHAP or feature importance can be added for better insights.
